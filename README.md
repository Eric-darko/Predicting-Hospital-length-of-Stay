Predicting Hospital Length of Stay
Overview
This project aims to predict hospital length of stay using machine learning classification models. Accurately predicting the duration a patient will stay can help optimize hospital resource allocation and improve patient care.

Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
scikit-learn for model building
pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
Workflow
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing and handling missing values.
Feature Engineering: Created features relevant to predicting length of stay.
Modeling: Built classification models (3-class and 4-class intervals) using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.
Key Results
The Random Forest classifier achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 87%.
